	<div class="text"><p>The website that I chose for this project was the UNA Portal website. 
	This is what the home screen currently looks like. 
	I am going to focus on the Search Box, the "My Sites" tab, and the Stay Connected Box.(above)</p></div>
	
  <div class="images"><img src="img/search.jpg" alt="UNA Portal Search"></div>
  
	<div class="text"><p>The Search function currently does not work.
	Anything that is searched will return no result. 
	This takes up a good portion of the home page and I think the best option would be to replace it with a more useful section. (above)</p></div>
	
  <div class="images"><img src="img/sites.jpg" alt="UNA Portal Search"></div>
  
	<div class="text"><p>The Sites drop down box has a section for Home and sections that are impossible to understand. 
	These sections link to classes that you are currently in.
	This drop down can be improved to show the name of the class that the site is for.(above)</p></div>
	
  <div class="images"><img src="img/connected.jpg" alt="UNA Portal Search"></div>
  
	<div class="text"><p>The Stay Connected box has an issue with resizing. 
	When making your window smaller the icons will float off to the right making them unable to click.
	This can be fixed by wrapping the links in a static div.(above)</p></div>
